Project Overview
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately recognize hand gestures representing American Sign Language (ASL) letters. The model focuses on classifying static hand signs for letters A-Z (excluding J and Z, which involve motion) using grayscale image data. By optimizing CNN architecture and applying strategic data preprocessing, this project aims to achieve high recognition accuracy.

Dataset Insights
The dataset follows a structure similar to the MNIST format, consisting of:
Training Set: 27,455 grayscale images (28×28 pixels each)
Test Set: 7,172 images for performance evaluation
Labels: Corresponding ASL letter representations
The dataset was preprocessed with normalization and augmented using rotation, zooming, and shifts to enhance model robustness.

Model Architecture
The CNN architecture is designed to efficiently extract spatial features and improve classification accuracy. 
It consists of:
Convolutional Layers – Extracts spatial patterns using feature maps with ReLU activation
Max Pooling Layers – Reduces dimensionality while retaining essential features
Batch Normalization – Speeds up convergence and stabilizes training
Dropout Layers – Prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons
Fully Connected Layers – Maps extracted features to label predictions
Softmax Output Layer – Provides probability scores for classification
The model undergoes extensive training, optimizing parameters to achieve precision while minimizing errors.

Performance Evaluation
After training, the model was tested on unseen data, yielding the following results:

Loss: 0.0302 – Indicates minimal prediction deviation
Accuracy: 99.03% – High classification precision
Additionally, an alternate evaluation showed:

Loss: 0.3177
Accuracy: 90.33%
These results suggest strong generalization, with room for further refinement.

Potential Enhancements
To push the model’s performance further, future improvements may include:
1.Exploring alternative CNN architectures such as ResNet or EfficientNet
2.Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimized learning rates and layer configurations
3.Incorporating advanced augmentation techniques like brightness adjustments and adaptive cropping
4.Expanding dataset diversity to include variations in hand shapes, lighting conditions, and backgrounds.

By iterating on these enhancements, the model can achieve even greater precision and real-world applicability.
